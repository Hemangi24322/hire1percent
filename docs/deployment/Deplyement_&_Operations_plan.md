This document outlines the strategy for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining the hiring consultancy web application. A robust deployment and operations plan is essential to ensure the application's continuous availability, performance, and reliability in a production environment.
1. Introduction
Deployment and ongoing operations are critical phases in the software lifecycle. This plan describes the processes, tools, and responsibilities for taking the web application from development to production and managing it effectively thereafter.
2. Deployment Strategy
The deployment strategy will focus on automation, reliability, and minimal downtime.
Platform Selection:
Frontend (React App): Firebase Hosting (CDN for static assets) or a similar static hosting service.
Backend (Node.js/Express API): Virtual Private Servers (VPS) or container orchestration platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes). For managed options, consider AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, or Azure Virtual Machines.
Database (MongoDB):
Option 1 (Self-Managed): Dedicated VPS or cloud instances. This provides maximum control but requires significant operational expertise.
Option 2 (Managed Service): MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB's official cloud database service). This handles the operational overhead (scaling, backups, monitoring) while still providing extensive configuration control and is deployed on major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
File Storage (Resumes): Dedicated Object Storage Service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or self-hosted MinIO/Ceph).
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
Tools: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, or Cloud Build (depending on cloud provider and preference).
Process:
Developers push code changes to the Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
CI pipeline is triggered: runs unit tests, integration tests, and builds artifacts (e.g., frontend bundles, backend Docker images).
Upon successful CI, CD pipeline is triggered for approved branches (e.g., main):
Frontend artifacts are built and deployed to Firebase Hosting or chosen static hosting.
Backend application/Docker image is deployed to the chosen server/container platform.
Database migrations/schema changes (if any) are applied.
Environment Strategy:
Development: Local machines, shared development environments.
Staging/UAT: A dedicated environment mirroring production, used for final testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Production: The live environment accessible to end-users.
Zero-Downtime Deployments:
Implement blue/green deployments or rolling updates for backend services to minimize downtime during deployments.
Static hosting (like Firebase Hosting) automatically handles rollbacks and serves the previous version if a new deployment fails.
3. Monitoring & Alerting
Comprehensive monitoring is crucial for detecting and diagnosing issues quickly.
Metrics Monitoring:
Tools: Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, or cloud-specific monitoring services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring, Azure Monitor).
Key Metrics:
Application Performance: Request latency, error rates, throughput for API endpoints.
Server Resources: CPU, memory, disk I/O, network usage of backend servers.
Database Performance (MongoDB): Query performance, connection pooling, replication lag, disk utilization, number of open cursors, page faults.
Frontend Performance: Page load times, core web vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) using tools like Google Analytics or Lighthouse CI.
Log Management:
Tools: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, DataDog, or cloud-specific logging services.
Logging Strategy:
Log all critical application events (e.g., user registrations, job postings, application submissions, authentication attempts).
Log all errors with relevant context (stack traces, request details).
Ensure logs are structured (JSON) for easier parsing and analysis.
Alerting:
Tools: Integrated with monitoring platforms (e.g., Prometheus Alertmanager, Datadog alerts).
Alert Triggers: Set up alerts for critical thresholds (e.g., error rate > 5% for 5 minutes, latency > 1 second, MongoDB replica set issues, high CPU usage).
Notification Channels: PagerDuty, Slack, email, SMS for critical alerts.
4. Incident Management
Process:
Detection: Alerts from monitoring systems.
Triage: Assess severity, identify affected components, assign to responsible team member.
Resolution: Implement fix, deploy hotfix if necessary, rollback if issues persist.
Post-Mortem: Conduct a blameless review to understand root cause, implement preventative measures, update documentation.
Runbooks: Create documented procedures for common operational tasks and incident response.
5. Backup & Disaster Recovery
Database Backups (MongoDB):
Self-Managed MongoDB: Implement regular full and incremental backups (e.g., using mongodump and mongorestore, or filesystem snapshots). Store backups in a secure, off-site location.
MongoDB Atlas: Utilize Atlas's automated backups and point-in-time recovery features.
Strategy: Define Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO).
File Storage Backups (Object Storage):
Object storage services typically have built-in redundancy and versioning, but ensure your configuration meets durability requirements.
Disaster Recovery Plan: Define procedures for recovering the application in case of a major outage or data center failure, including clear steps for restoring each component.
6. Security Operations
Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security scans and penetration tests.
Vulnerability Management: Monitor for known vulnerabilities in all dependencies, including MongoDB, and apply patches promptly.
Access Management: Regularly review and revoke access permissions for all environments and database users. Implement network security (firewalls, VPCs).
Audit Logging: Maintain detailed audit logs of all administrative actions, database operations, and system events for compliance and troubleshooting.
7. Maintenance & Optimization
Regular Updates: Keep all dependencies, frameworks, and underlying infrastructure (OS, MongoDB, Node.js) up-to-date.
Cost Optimization: Regularly review cloud resource usage and identify areas for cost reduction.
Performance Optimization: Continuously monitor performance metrics and identify bottlenecks for optimization (e.g., MongoDB query optimization, indexing).
Database Housekeeping: Regular maintenance tasks like compaction, index rebuilding (if applicable).
The documents have been updated to reflect your decision to use MongoDB as the primary database, emphasizing the control it provides and detailing how it impacts the overall architecture, security practices, and deployment strategy.
I have updated the following Canvas documents:
hiring_consultancy_app_plan (updated Database section and MongoDB schema terminology)
security_considerations (updated database and file storage security aspects)
tech_stack_selection (updated Database, File Storage, and Authentication sections with MongoDB and related choices)
deployment_operations_plan (updated Platform Selection, Monitoring, and Backup sections for MongoDB)
The hiring_consultancy_workflow, ui_ux_design_spec, api_design_doc, and requirements_spec documents were found to be sufficiently general or already aligned with the NoSQL paradigm, so no changes were explicitly required for them based on this database switch.
Let me know if you need any other documents updated or new ones created!
