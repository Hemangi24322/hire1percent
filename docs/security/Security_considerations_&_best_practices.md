This document outlines crucial security considerations and best practices for developing the hiring consultancy web application. Implementing robust security measures from the outset is essential to protect sensitive user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain trust.
1. Introduction
Security is not an afterthought but an integral part of the development process. Given the sensitive nature of information handled by a hiring platform (personal details, resumes, company data), a strong security posture is paramount. This document highlights key areas of focus for securing the application.
2. Authentication & Authorization
Secure Authentication:
Password Hashing: Always store user passwords as salted and hashed values using strong, modern hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Never store plain text passwords.
Account Lockout: Implement a mechanism to temporarily lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
Rate Limiting: Limit the number of login attempts from a single IP address over a period.
Session Management: Use secure, server-side session management or JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) with appropriate expiry times and refresh token mechanisms.
Force Password Change: Implement policies that prompt users to change default or weak passwords.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
Strictly define and enforce permissions for each user role (Candidate, Employer, Admin).
A candidate should only be able to view/edit their own profile and applications.
An employer should only be able to manage their own jobs and applications to those jobs.
Admins should have elevated, but carefully managed, access to all data and functions.
All API endpoints must be protected by authorization checks.
3. Data Protection
Data Encryption:
Data in Transit (TLS/SSL): All communication between the client (browser) and the server must be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS/SSL). This prevents eavesdropping and tampering.
Data at Rest: Consider encryption for sensitive data stored in the database. For MongoDB, consider filesystem-level encryption, disk encryption, or features offered by managed MongoDB services (like MongoDB Atlas's Encryption at Rest).
Input Validation & Sanitization:
Server-Side Validation: All user input must be validated on the server-side, even if client-side validation is present. This protects against malicious data injection.
Sanitization: Sanitize input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters or scripts (e.g., HTML tags, JavaScript code) before storing or displaying them.
4. Common Web Vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
Address the following common vulnerabilities:
Injection (NoSQL Injection, etc.): Prevent malicious code from being injected into MongoDB queries. Use parameterized queries or ORMs/ODMs (Object-Document Mappers) provided by MongoDB drivers to build queries safely.
Broken Authentication: Covered under "Authentication & Authorization".
Sensitive Data Exposure: Covered under "Data Encryption" and "Input Validation".
XML External Entities (XXE): If parsing XML, disable DTDs and external entity processing.
Broken Access Control: Covered under "Role-Based Access Control".
Security Misconfiguration: Ensure all components (servers, database, frameworks, MongoDB configurations) are securely configured with default credentials removed, unnecessary services disabled, and up-to-date patches.
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
Output Encoding: Encode user-supplied data before displaying it in HTML to prevent browser execution of scripts.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a robust CSP header to restrict where resources can be loaded from.
Insecure Deserialization: Be cautious when deserializing untrusted data.
Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: Regularly update all third-party libraries and frameworks (including MongoDB server and drivers) to their latest versions. Use security scanners to identify known vulnerabilities.
Insufficient Logging & Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging of security-relevant events (e.g., failed logins, access to sensitive data). Monitor logs for suspicious activity.
5. File Upload Security
Best Practice: External Object Storage: For storing PDF resumes, the best practice is to store them in a dedicated, secure object storage service (e.g., Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or a self-hosted solution like MinIO/Ceph). Only the URL or reference to the file should be stored in the MongoDB document.
If Storing in MongoDB (GridFS): If using MongoDB's GridFS for file storage (e.g., for larger files or if a single data store is preferred):
File Size Limits: Enforce limits on file size at the application layer.
Restrict File Types: Allow only specific, safe file types (e.g., PDF, DOCX for resumes).
Virus Scanning: Integrate with a virus scanning service for uploaded files.
Unique File Names: Generate unique, unguessable file names to prevent directory traversal or overwriting existing files.
Access Control: Ensure GridFS collections have appropriate access controls.
6. Admin Panel Security
Strongest Authentication: Admin accounts should use the strongest authentication methods, possibly with multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Least Privilege: Admin roles should be strictly limited to the necessary functions.
Separate Login: Consider a separate login portal or highly restricted access for the admin dashboard.
Audit Logs: Maintain detailed audit logs of all administrative actions.
7. Regular Security Audits & Testing
Code Reviews: Conduct peer code reviews with a security focus.
Vulnerability Scans: Use automated security scanners.
Penetration Testing: Engage security professionals for penetration testing to identify real-world vulnerabilities.
Security Updates: Stay informed about new security vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.
