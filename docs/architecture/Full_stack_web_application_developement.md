This document outlines a plan for developing a full-stack web application for a hiring consultancy, focusing on key features, user roles, database considerations, and a high-level architectural overview. This will serve as a foundational guide for your development efforts.
1. Introduction
The goal is to create a robust and intuitive web application that facilitates the connection between job candidates and employers through a hiring consultancy. The platform will provide dedicated dashboards for each user type, enabling efficient job matching, application tracking, and candidate selection.
2. Core Features
The application will include the following key features:
User Registration & Authentication: Secure sign-up and login for both candidates and employers, and an administrative login.
User Profiles:
Candidate Profile: Personal details, contact information, resume/CV upload, skills, experience, education, preferred job timings.
Employer Profile: Company details, contact information, industry, company description.
Admin Profile: Basic administrative credentials.
Job Management (Employer):
Post new job openings (job title, description, requirements, location, salary range, timings).
View, edit, and delete posted jobs.
Manage job applications received.
Job Search & Application (Candidate):
Browse available jobs based on criteria (keywords, location, industry, timings).
View detailed job descriptions.
Apply for jobs.
Track application status.
Candidate Management (Employer):
View a list of candidates who applied for their jobs.
Access candidate resumes/profiles.
Shortlist, select, or reject candidates.
Make job offers.
Offer Management:
Employer: Send job offers to selected candidates.
Candidate: View and accept/reject job offers.
Dashboards:
Candidate Dashboard:
Overview of applied jobs, application statuses.
Recommended jobs.
History of applications and offers received.
Profile management.
Employer Dashboard:
Overview of active job postings.
Summary of applications received.
List of shortlisted/selected candidates.
History of posted jobs, selected candidates, and offers made.
Company profile management.
Admin Dashboard:
User Management: View, search, edit (e.g., status, role), and potentially deactivate/delete candidate and employer accounts.
Job Posting Management: View, edit, or remove any job postings.
Application & Offer Oversight: Monitor applications and offers across the platform.
System Analytics/Reporting: Basic statistics on active users, job postings, applications, etc.
Content Moderation: Ability to review and manage user-generated content (e.g., inappropriate job descriptions or profile content).
Communication:
In-app messaging or notification system for offers, status updates, etc. (Optional, can be added in later phases).
3. User Roles
The application will primarily support three main user roles:
Candidate: Individuals seeking employment.
Employer: Companies or individuals looking to hire.
Admin (Consultancy Staff): Users with elevated privileges to manage the platform and its users.
4. High-Level Architecture (Conceptual)
A typical full-stack web application can be broken down into three main layers:
Frontend (Client-side): The user interface that users interact with.
Technologies: HTML, CSS (with a framework like Tailwind CSS), JavaScript (with a library/framework like React).
Backend (Server-side): Handles business logic, data processing, and API endpoints.
Technologies: Node.js (with Express.js), Python (with Django/Flask), Java (with Spring Boot), etc.
Database: Stores all application data.
Technologies: MongoDB (NoSQL, recommended for flexibility and scalability) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (Relational).
Data Flow:
User interacts with the Frontend.
Frontend sends requests (e.g., login, post job, apply) to the Backend API.
Backend processes the request, interacts with the Database (stores, retrieves, updates data).
Backend sends a response back to the Frontend.
Frontend updates the UI based on the response.
5. Database Schema (Conceptual - Using MongoDB Terminology)
Here's a conceptual outline of collections and documents for a MongoDB database. This can be adapted if a relational database is chosen.
Collections:
users Collection:
Purpose: Stores authentication and basic profile information for all users.
Documents (_id - ObjectId):
email: String
passwordHash: String (securely hashed)
role: String ("candidate", "employer", or "admin")
createdAt: Date
lastLogin: Date
status: String (e.g., "Active", "Inactive", "Suspended" - useful for admin management)
candidates Collection:
Purpose: Stores detailed candidate profiles.
Documents (_id - ObjectId, typically linked to users._id):
userId: ObjectId (Reference to users collection _id)
firstName: String
lastName: String
contactNumber: String
address: String
resumeRef: String (URL to a stored resume file in object storage, or GridFS _id if stored in MongoDB)
skills: Array of Strings
experience: Array of Objects (e.g., {title: "...", company: "...", years: "..."})
education: Array of Objects (e.g., {degree: "...", institution: "...", year: "..."})
preferredTimings: String/Array of Strings (e.g., "Full-time", "Part-time", "Flexible")
bio: String
profileUpdated: Date
employers Collection:
Purpose: Stores detailed employer profiles.
Documents (_id - ObjectId, typically linked to users._id):
userId: ObjectId (Reference to users collection _id)
companyName: String
contactPerson: String
contactEmail: String
contactNumber: String
address: String
industry: String
companyDescription: String
website: String (Optional)
profileUpdated: Date
jobs Collection:
Purpose: Stores job postings.
Documents (_id - ObjectId):
employerId: ObjectId (Reference to users or employers collection _id)
jobTitle: String
description: String
requirements: Array of Strings
location: String
salaryRange: String
jobType: String (e.g., "Full-time", "Part-time")
postedDate: Date
expiryDate: Date (Optional)
status: String (e.g., "Active", "Closed", "Archived" - useful for admin management)
requiredTimings: String/Array of Strings
employerName: String (Denormalized for easier querying)
applications Collection:
Purpose: Tracks job applications.
Documents (_id - ObjectId):
jobId: ObjectId (Reference to jobs collection _id)
candidateId: ObjectId (Reference to users or candidates collection _id)
applicationDate: Date
status: String ("Pending", "Reviewed", "Shortlisted", "Rejected", "Offered", "Hired")
employerNotes: String (Optional, for employer use)
candidateName: String (Denormalized)
jobTitle: String (Denormalized)

acceptanceDate: Date (Optional)
history Collection:
Purpose: Stores historical records for both candidates and employers.

eventType: String ("jobPosted", "applicationSubmitted", "candidateSelected", "offerMade", "offerAccepted", "userDeactivated", "jobArchived", etc.)
eventDate: Date
relatedEntityId: ObjectId (e.g., jobId, applicationId, offerId, managedUserId)

6. Next Steps
With this document, you have a foundational understanding of the application's scope. The next steps would involve:
Detailed Frontend Design: Wireframes and mockups for each dashboard and page.
API Design: Defining specific API endpoints for all interactions between frontend and backend.
Technology Stack Selection: Finalizing the specific frameworks and libraries.
Development Sprints: Breaking down the project into manageable development phases.
Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any specific section or generate a document for a particular part of the development process (e.g., a detailed React frontend structure, a backend API design, or database setup instructions).
