This document outlines conceptual wireframes for the key dashboards and pages of your hiring consultancy web application. These wireframes focus on the layout, content placement, and hierarchy of elements on each screen, providing a low-fidelity visual guide before detailed UI design.
1. Introduction
Wireframes are essential for visualizing the structure and functionality of a web application. They help ensure that all necessary information is present and that the user flow is logical and intuitive. This document describes the core elements you would expect to see on each primary screen for the Candidate, Employer, and Admin roles.

4. Next Steps
These detailed conceptual wireframes provide a comprehensive blueprint for the UI/UX design. The next crucial steps would involve:
Creating actual wireframe images using design tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD). This visual representation will make the layouts concrete.
Adding more granular detail to interactive elements (e.g., hover states, error states for form fields, loading indicators).
Developing high-fidelity mockups applying a visual design language (color, typography, iconography).
Creating interactive prototypes to simulate user journeys and gather early feedback through user testing.
