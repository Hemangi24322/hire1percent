This document provides guidelines for the code generation phase of your hiring consultancy web application. It outlines best practices, architectural considerations, and specific approaches for both frontend and backend development to ensure a maintainable, scalable, and secure codebase.

1. Introduction

Effective code generation is crucial for translating design and requirements into a functional application. These guidelines aim to standardize development practices, promote code quality, and facilitate collaborative work throughout the project.

2. General Code Principles

Clean Code: Write code that is easy to read, understand, and modify. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.

Modularity & Reusability: Break down functionality into small, independent, and reusable modules or components.

Maintainability: Design code for long-term readability and ease of updates. Avoid overly complex logic.

Scalability: Write code that can handle increasing loads and data volumes. Consider asynchronous operations and efficient data processing.

Security First: Implement security measures at every layer of the application, from input validation to authentication and authorization.

Performance Optimization: Write efficient code, minimize unnecessary computations, and optimize database queries.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms, catching and gracefully managing errors on both frontend and backend.

Documentation (Inline): Use clear and concise comments to explain complex logic, function purposes, and important design decisions within the code itself.

3. Frontend Code Generation (React)

The frontend will be built using React with Tailwind CSS.

3.1. Component Structure

Functional Components & Hooks: Prefer functional components and React Hooks for state management and side effects.

Component Hierarchy: Organize components logically, from atomic (buttons, inputs) to molecules (forms, cards) to organisms (sections, dashboards) and templates/pages.

State Management:

Use useState for local component state.

For shared or global state, consider React Context API or a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux if complexity demands it).

Props: Use props for passing data and functions down the component tree. Destructure props for readability.

3.2. Styling (Tailwind CSS)

Utility-First Approach: Apply Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in JSX for styling.

Responsive Design: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) extensively to ensure layouts adapt to different screen sizes.

Customization: Use tailwind.config.js for defining custom colors, fonts, spacing, etc., to maintain design consistency.

Component Classes (Optional): For complex, reusable components, consider using @apply directive within a CSS file (or directly in JSX) to group common utility classes.

3.3. API Integration

Asynchronous Operations: Use async/await for handling API calls.

Data Fetching: Implement data fetching logic within useEffect hooks or dedicated custom hooks.

Loading and Error States: Always handle loading indicators and error messages when making API requests.

Axios/Fetch: Use fetch API or a library like Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.

3.4. Routing

Conditional Rendering: For multi-page applications, use conditional rendering (switch case) or a simple state-based routing mechanism within the App component as demonstrated in the base code. Avoid external routing libraries like react-router-dom unless explicitly required for complex nested routing.

3.5. Form Handling

Manage form input states.

Implement client-side validation for immediate user feedback.

Sanitize and validate input on the server-side as the primary security measure.

4. Backend Code Generation (Node.js with Express.js)

The backend will handle API requests, business logic, and database interactions.

4.1. Project Structure

Modular Organization: Separate routes, controllers, services/logic, models, and middleware into distinct directories.

routes/: Defines API endpoints.

controllers/: Contains logic for handling requests and sending responses.

services/ or logic/: Business logic, reusable functions.

models/: Defines database schema (e.g., Mongoose schemas for MongoDB).

middleware/: Authentication, authorization, error handling middleware.

config/: Configuration files (e.g., database connection strings, JWT secrets).

4.2. API Implementation

RESTful Endpoints: Adhere to RESTful principles for clear and consistent API design (as outlined in the API Design Documentation).

Input Validation: Validate all incoming request payloads on the server using libraries like Joi or Express-validator.

Error Handling: Implement a centralized error handling middleware to catch and return consistent error responses.

Authentication & Authorization:

Use JWTs for token-based authentication.

Implement middleware to verify tokens and enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for each endpoint.

Asynchronous Operations: Use async/await for database operations and other I/O tasks.

4.3. Database Interaction (MongoDB)

ODM (Object-Document Mapper): Use Mongoose (for Node.js) to interact with MongoDB. Mongoose provides schema validation, model relationships, and a simpler API for database operations.

Schema Design: Design MongoDB schemas thoughtfully, considering embedding vs. referencing based on access patterns and data relationships (as discussed in Database Recommendation).

Indexing: Create appropriate indexes on frequently queried fields to optimize read performance.

Query Optimization: Write efficient MongoDB queries, leveraging aggregation pipelines for complex data retrieval.

4.4. File Storage

When a user uploads a resume (PDF), the backend should:

Receive the file.

Validate its type and size.

Upload it to the chosen object storage service (e.g., S3, GCS).

Store the generated public/private URL (or reference ID) in the corresponding MongoDB document (e.g., candidates.resumeRef).

For downloading, generate a signed URL or serve the file through your backend if access control is needed.

5. Version Control and Collaboration

Gitflow/Feature Branching: Use a structured Git workflow (e.g., Gitflow, GitHub Flow) to manage code changes.

Branches:

main/master: Production-ready code.

develop: Integration branch for new features.

feature/: For individual features.

bugfix/: For bug fixes.

Pull Requests (PRs): Use PRs for code review before merging changes into develop or main. Ensure thorough reviews for quality, adherence to guidelines, and potential issues.

6. Testing in Code

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for individual functions, components, and modules (e.g., utility functions, React components, backend controllers).

Tools: Jest (JavaScript), Mocha/Chai.

Integration Tests: Test the interaction between different parts of your application (e.g., frontend components interacting with mock APIs, backend services interacting with the database).

End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Automate tests that simulate full user journeys through the application (e.g., candidate registration, job application).

Tools: Cypress, Playwright.

7. Deployment Considerations (from a Code Perspective)

Environment Variables: Use environment variables (e.g., process.env.NODE_ENV, process.env.MONGO_URI, process.env.JWT_SECRET) for configuration settings that vary between environments (development, staging, production). Never hardcode sensitive information.

Build Process: Automate the build process for both frontend (e.g., Webpack, Vite) and backend (e.g., Docker images).

Logging: Implement comprehensive logging at appropriate levels (info, warn, error) to aid debugging and monitoring in production. Use a logging library (e.g., Winston for Node.js).

8. Recommended Tools & Technologies (Recap)

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui, Recharts, Lucide React.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction).

Database: MongoDB.

File Storage: Object Storage Service (e.g., AWS S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage).
